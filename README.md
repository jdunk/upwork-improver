## Hide already-rejected jobs

Why keep showing the ghosts/shells of jobs that the user has already explicitly said they're not interested in? (This poor UX choice is especially senseless the moment one considers the real-world result in most cases is an enormous noise-to-signal ratio -- e.g. 90% of results in list are jobs that have already been rejected!)
