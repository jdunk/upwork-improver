## Hide already-rejected jobs

Why keep showing the skeletons of jobs that the user has already explicitly declared they're not interested in? ðŸ’€ðŸ™…ðŸ’€ðŸš«

(This poor UX choice -- to always continue to show all rejected jobs -- is especially senseless the moment one observes the real-world result in the overwhelming majority of cases, which is an absurdly-high noise-to-signal ratio, e.g. 90% of the results shown are jobs that have _already been rejected!_)
